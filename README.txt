How to run the code, including very specific compilation instructions, if compilation is needed. Instructions such as "compile using g++" are NOT considered specific.
	
	Download the 20_newsgroups data folder at the following link. https://elearning.mines.edu/courses/6675/files/250190/download?verifier=8YKVFrZS3JqrZ3RZQBxZsSLonVABR7M8CU2707Om&wrap=1
	Make sure the extracted 20_newsgroups folder is in the root of the project folder. (I did not include the 20_newsgroups folder because of the size)
	Run the Project.py using Python 2.7 and follow on screen instructions.
	You can check the version of python by runnning the command "python" in the command prompt. You can change the python version by renaming the executable file of the python27 version in the program files of the c: drive.
	To run specific folders open the Project.py and uncomment and change the selected_folders variable to overwrite the selection. After changes save and run the program as stated above.
